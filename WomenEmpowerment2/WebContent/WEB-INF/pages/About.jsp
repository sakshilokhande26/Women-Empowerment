The grant-in-aid under the Scheme is given to institutions/ organizations including NGOs.

<p>
The guidelines of STEP Scheme have been revised in December, 2014 by Ministry of Women and Child Development. In addition, other sector specific Ministries and State Governments have skill development programmes of their own.

                       <h3> How to raise funds for NGO?</h3>
                        <P>
                            We provide information support and help to raise funds to the deserving and
well recognised NGOs. The support means the support at information and
eligibility process part. We do not provide any fund or contact to provide fund
from any agency, authority or fund provider donors. After getting the basic
information the for project documentation and projects NGO management
directly have to contact to the funding agencies through their allowed
process, including the Government ministries, Private Funding Agencies or
Companies provide funds under Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). NGO
can prepare the projects at their part or can take consultancy service to
prepare projects to get funds. The new NGOs and working NGOs which
need financial support from the Government and private funding agencies so
they can implement their concepts through the applicable process. NGOs

persons who wish to form NGOs and want economical and other support with
he help of projects and other support. At the online resource centre

projects, Funding and other resourceful material regarding running, managing
and implementation of concepts of social change by achieving funding and

                <P>
Non Government Organisation (NGO) is citizen based non profit group works
for social welfare and sustainable development. The main aim and objective
of any NGO is same as the aim of Government for development of society.
Governments have control on resources but the organisations formed and
working for the welfare and development do not have resources so they have
to arrange and manage resources. NGOs function for without any profit but
can work with funds and financial resources in present system. So funding is
the basic and main part to run and organise the programmes they use to work
or want to work.
</P>

    <p>
        So if any NGO wants to work with capacity it needs to get grants from various
sources. NGOs can get grant from various sources, individual donors,
foundations, corporations and Governments. Funding sources for NGO
include membership fees, private donations, public donations, grants from
local, national and foreign funding agencies, philanthropic foundations,
Government funding schemes, sale of products and services and CSR funds
from private corporate sector companies. NGO requires funds for the required
resources for the Project implementation, operations, salaries and other
overhead costs. Fundraising efforts are necessary for existence, operation of
programmes and success in the aims of NGO.
